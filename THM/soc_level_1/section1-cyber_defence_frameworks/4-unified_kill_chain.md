 Paul Pols' Unified Kill Chain, published in 2017, is a cybersecurity kill chain framework. previously we talked about lockheed martin framework.

* The UKC states that there are 18 phases to an attack.
*  UKC is a modern extension of other frameworks

## Introduction

### 1 Reconnissance
researching, identifying, and selecting targets using active or passive reconnaissance.

### 2 Weaponization
Prepare activities aimed at *setting up the infrastructure* required for the attack

### 3 Delivery
Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponized object to the targeted environment.

### 4 Social Engineering
Techniques aimed at the manipulation of people to perform unsafe actions,

### 5 Exploitation
Techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in systems that may amongst others, result in code execution.

### 6 Persistence
Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent pressence on the system.

### 7 Defensive Evasion
Techniques an attacker may apecifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.

### 8 Command & Control
Techniques that allow attackers to communicate with controlled systems within a target network.

### 9 Pivoting
Tunneling traffic through a controlled system to other systems that are not directly accessible.

### 10 Discovery
Techniques that allow an attacker to gain knowledge about a system and its network environment.

### 11 Privilege Escalation
The result of techniques that provide an attacker with higher permissions on asystem or network.

### 12 Execution
Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code an a local or remote systems.

### 13 Credential Access
Techniques resulting in the access of, or control over, system, service or domain credentials.

### 14 Lateral Movement
Techniques that enable an adversary to horizontally access and control other remote systems.

### 15 Collection
Techniques used to identify and gather data from a target network prior to exfilteration

### 16 Exfilteration
Techniques that result or aid in an attacker removing data from a target network.

### 17 Impact
Techniques aimed at manipulating, interrupting, or destroying the target system or data.

### 18 Objectives
Socio-Technical objectives of an attck that are intended to achieve a strategic goal.
