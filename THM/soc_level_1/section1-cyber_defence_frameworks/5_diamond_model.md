* The Diamond Model can help you identify the elements of an intrusion
* Diamond Model is composed of four core features: adversary, infrastructure, capability, and victim

## Adversary
An adversary is also known as an attacker, enemy, cyber threat actor, or hacker. adversary can be a actor or organization.

* **Adversary Operator** is the “hacker” or person(s) conducting the intrusion activity.
* **Adversary Customer** is the entity that stands to benefit from the activity conducted in the intrusion. It may be the same person who stands behind the adversary operator, or it may be a separate person or group.

## Infrastructure
Infrastructure – is also known as software or hardware. Infrastructure is the physical or logical interconnections that the adversary uses to deliver a capability or maintain control of capabilities.

* Type 1 Infrastructure is the infrastructure controlled or owned by the adversary. 
* Type 2 Infrastructure is the infrastructure controlled by an intermediary. 
* Service Providers are organizations that provide services considered critical for the adversary availability of Type 1 and Type 2 Infrastructures, for example, Internet Service Providers, domain registrars, and webmail providers.
