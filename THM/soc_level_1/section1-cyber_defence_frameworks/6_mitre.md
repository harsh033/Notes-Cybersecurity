**APT** - APT   is an acronym for  A dvanced Persistent Threat .  This can be considered a team/group ( threat group ), or even country ( nation-state group ), that engages in long-term attacks against organizations and/or countries.

**TTP** - is acronym for Tactics, Techniques, and procedures
    * The Tactic is the adversary's goal or objective
    * The Technique is how the adversary achieves the goal or objective.
    * The Procedure is how the technique is executed.

## ATT&CK
MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

## CAR Knowledge base
The MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) is a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE based on the MITRE ATT&CK ®  adversary model. CAR defines a data model that is leveraged in its pseudocode representations but also includes implementations directly targeted at specific tools (e.g., Splunk, EQL) in its analytics. With respect to coverage, CAR is focused on providing a set of validated and well-explained analytics, in particular with regards to their operating theory and rationale.

## MITRE Engage
 MITRE Engage  is a framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations that empowers you to engage your adversaries and achieve your cybersecurity goals.

## MITRE D3FEND

A knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures.
* D3FEND  stands for  D etection,  D enial, and  D isruption  F ramework  E mpowering  N etwork  D efense.  

## ATT&CK Emulation Plans

**CTID** - MITRE formed an organization named The  Center of Threat-Informed Defense  ( CTID ). This organization consists of various companies and vendors from around the globe. Their objective is to conduct research on cyber threats and their TTPs and share this research to improve cyber defense for all. 

## ATT&CK and Threat Intelligence

Threat Intelligence (TI)  or Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is the information, or TTPs, attributed to the adversary. By using threat intelligence, as defenders, we can make better decisions regarding the defensive strategy.
